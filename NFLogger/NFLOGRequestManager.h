    Prefreable choice would be to use "sync" NSURLConnection, but since the API is deprecated, we are using NSURLSession.
 
    Note that "sync"-ronization care is taken through NFRequestManager's uploadAndDelete method while retrieving entries,
    and then the entries are send to NSURLSession's operation queue to upload. This is to make sure, proper order is ensured .
 
    The completion block implementation in method, makes sure, that we are sending the results in the serialQueue, which takes care of deleting the entries from the database.
