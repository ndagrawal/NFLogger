    @brief Serial Queue to dispatch tasks in FIFO fashion.
    Serial Queue is defined as we want task to happen in FIFO fashion.
    Serial Queues allows only one task at a time, 
    hence only thread accesses the database file at one time to open write and close. This complies with the design of Sqlite Database.

 Note :
 Prefreable choice would be to use "sync" NSURLConnection, but since the API is deprecated, we are using NSURLSession.
 
 Note that "sync"-ronization care is taken through NFRequestManager's uploadAndDeleteMethod while retrieving entries,
 and then the entries are send to NSURLSession's operation queue to upload. This is to make sure, proper order is ensured .
 
 The completion block implementation in uploadAndDeleteAll method,
 makes sure, that we are sending the results in the serialQueue,
 which takes care of deleting the entries from the database.
